prepTime: 5 min
cookTime: 10 min
recipeYield: 1 (2 wraps)

ingredients:
- 2 sausages
- 2 bacon rashers
- 1 egg
- 2 wraps
- milk
- ketchup (optional)

directions:
- Begin by cutting the sausages in half and frying them ensuring that they're cooked the whole way through.
- Next, fry the bacon.
- Next, possibly while the bacon is frying, crack an egg into a bowl, add a dash of milk and whisk it
- Then, put the egg mixture into the microwave for a minute, take it out and whisk it again, do this twice again or until the scrambled egg is ready.
- Add the sausage, bacon and scrambled egg to a wrap (I recommend two sausage halves, a bacon rasher and half the bowl of scrambled egg per wrap). Add ketchup if desired.
