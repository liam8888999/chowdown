tags: french, cheesefare

recipeYield: ~15/20 galettes.

ingredients:
- 500g buckwheat flour
- 1 egg
- 70cl water

directions:
- Mix flour, salt, egg and water. (In this order to avoid dry flour)
- Let it rest one hour at room temperature.
- Cook the galette on a crepe-maker or a big flat pan.
- When garnishing, heat the galette again with a bit of salted butter.

handyhints:
- Always keep the crepe-maker's T stick in water while cooking so the dough doesn't dry on it. It will then be easier to spread the dough.
