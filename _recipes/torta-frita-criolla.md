A "merienda" (afternoon meal) that is intertwined with the history of colonization on the River Plate region. Never have it by yourself, instead with friends or family, and a cup/gourd of Mate.

prepTime: 1h 10min or 2h 10min, (depending on how long you leave it to rest.)
- üç≥Cook time: 10 minutes.
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings : 10.

ingredients:
- 1.1 pound (1/2 kilo) of all-purpose flour.
- 4 tablespoons of lard or butter.
- 1/2 cup of water mixed with a teaspoon of salt.
- Oil or grease of choice for frying. (Modern Argentines use refined tallow or sunflower seed oil, but for the real gaucho way, unrefined lard or tallow is the right choice)
- Sugar, cinnamon, or herbs and spices of choice (Optional)

directions:
- Add the flour on a bowl, and the grease in ambient temperature in the middle.
- Mix flour and grease with your fingertips, while slowly adding the salt water, until you end up with a dough ball.
- Knead it energically, until the dough forms bubbles on its surface.
- Let it rest for 1 or 2 hours, and then form little balls, the size you'd do for a chocolate chip cookie, smash them to a disc shape, then poke a small hole in the middle.
- Fry it on abundant grease until golden brown, remove it with a perforated spoon, then put it on a bowl with paper towels to absorb excess grease.
- Add garnishes, but it is not essential, due to how rich and filling the dish is.
