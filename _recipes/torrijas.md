Torrijas are a spanish dessert traditionally eaten during the Holy Week (Easter).
It is said they were first cooked using the leftovers from the Lent.

- Eggs (to coat the bread, 2 eggs per 16 torrijas approx.)
- Cinnamon
- Grated lemon rind (optional)

directions:
- Mull the milk with cinnamon and a bit of sugar (not too much, the milk is already sweet). Add the lemon rind if you want.
- Cool down the milk.
- While the milk is cooling, beat the eggs and heat up half a pan of olive oil.
- Cut the dry bread in slices. Soak it in the milk.
- Coat the bread soaking it in the beaten eggs.
