Sauerkraut is a based lacto-fermented food that is healthy and has a long shelf live.

ingredients:
- 1 head of cabbage
- 2-4% sea salt by cabbage weight

directions:
- Prepare and clean as many glass jars as you think you'll need.
- Chop or shred cabbage and rinse under cold water. Sprinkle with salt.
- Knead the cabbage with clean hands for about 10 minutes until there is enough liquid to cover it.
- Stuff the cabbage into a glass jar, pressing the cabbage underneath the liquid. If necessary, add a bit of water to completely cover the cabbage.
- Cover the jar with a tight lid, airlock lid, or coffee filter secured with a rubber band.
- Culture at room temperature (60-70°F/15-20°C is preferred) for at least 2 weeks, until desired flavor and texture is achieved. If using a tight lid, burp it daily to release excess pressure.
- Once the sauerkraut is finished, put a tight lid on the jar and move to cold storage. The sauerkraut's flavor will continue to develop as it ages.
