- Drain the pasta, place it in the pan and save the boiling water for later use.
- Add the pasta with the pepper with 2 spoons of the water previously saved.
- Prepare the Pecorino by putting half of it a bowl with a spoon of the pasta water you saved; continue mixing the cheese with the water until a cream is formed.

Cacio e Pepe (meaning cheese and pepper) is not only based but also incredibly simple, ideal for lazy neets and similarly minded people who don't want to wash too many dishes and don't like complicated recipes with too many extra ingredients.
