Rice is easy to make in any pot.
The simple use of different spices can change its use or what it accents.

ingredients:
- rice
- [chicken stock](/recipes/chicken-stock-bone-broth) (optional)
- onion or garlic (optional)
- lime and cilantro (optional, for a Mexican taste)

directions:
- Add some amount of rice to a pot that has a cover.
- Add twice as much liquid to the same pot. Water is typical, but for extra flavor, use stock or broth.
- If desired, dice onion or garlic and mix into rice.
- Cover the pot, put it on the stove and turn the heat on the highest level.
- As soon as you hear the water beginning to bubble and boil over, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer.
- Wait for twenty minutes or so until the liquid has evaporated and the rice will be ready.

### For Mexican rice

For Mexican rice, you might want to avoid cooking in stock to avoid taste clashes.

- Dice up some cilantro.
- Mix in cilantro to finished rice, along with some squeezes of lime juice.
