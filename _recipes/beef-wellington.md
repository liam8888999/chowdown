tags: english, beef

cookTime: 2 hours
recipeYield: "4"
prepTime: 10 min

ingredients:
- 1lb of **Fillet** Beef
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1lb of mushrooms
- 4 Thinly Cut Slices of Ham
- 2tbsp of Yellow Mustard
- 7oz of Puff Pastry
- 2 Egg Yolks Beaten

directions:
- Season the fillet with salt and black pepper.
- With a nicely-oiled pan on high heat, sear the fillet on all sides, including the ends.  For the standard medium-rare beef wellington, do not cook the fillet, just sear it, tough if you want something more cooked than medium-rare, it's wise to give it more heat here.  Put it aside on a plate.
- Brush the fillet with yellow mustard *immediatly* after taking it out of the pan.  This allows the musturd's flavour to be absorbed by the fillet and thus preserve a mildly hot flavor.
- Chop the mushrooms. Put them in a food processor. Transfer the purée to a sauté pan that has been heated to medium high heat to cook. Allow the mushrooms to release their moisture; once the moisture has been boiled away take the mushrooms out of pan to cool.
- Lay out the slices of ham on plastic wrap and spread the mushroom mixture over the ham.  Place the fillet in the middle.  Wrap the fillet into a tight barrel shape twist the end of the plastic wrap to secure the wrap and the refrigerate the whole thing for 20 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 302°F/150°C.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll out a sheet of puff pastry to a size that will fit the fillet.  Preserve a little excess pastry. Unwrap the fillet-mushroom-ham from the plastic wrap and place in the middle of the pastry dough.  Brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg yolks.
- Place the pastry-wrapped thing on a baking tray. Brush the exposed surface again with the beaten eggs. Optionally, score the top of the pastry with a knife, to give it a better presentation.  Scratch the surface of it but don't cut it through.  Season it through with coarse salt.
- Bake at 302°F/105°C for 35-42 minutes. The pastry should be nicely golden when done.  Let it rest for about 10 minutes and cut it into 1in/2.54cm-thick slices for presentation.

note:
- Fillet beef is preferred.  It gives the beef wellington a soft, tender and juicy flavour.  Trust me, using fillet is worth it.
