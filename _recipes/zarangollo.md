Simple veggie starter/side dish from Murcia (Southeastern Spain)

prepTime: 5 min
cookTime: 10-15 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 2

ingredients:
- 1 White onion
- 1 Eggplant
- Olive oil
- Egg (optional)

directions:
- Cut onion in julienne (a third or half of an onion ring)
- Cut the eggplant in slices or chunks that can fit in a teaspoon
- Add oil to a pan (not a shallow one, wide and a bit deep is ideal if you have one) until it barely covers the vegetables
- Cook and stir in medium heat until they are tender, caramelized and translucent
- Kick up the heat to give them a crispy touch, but not for long
- (Optional) Turn off the heat and crack open an egg on top
- (Optional) Let the residual heat cook the egg. If it breaks just scramble it, the recipe doesn't call for anything fancy
- You can serve the dish with that oil (provided it is not burnt) or keep it for cooking other stuff
