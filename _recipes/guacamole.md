![Fresh Guacamole](/recipes/pix/guacamole.webp)

A nice recipe that functions as a delicious and fresh appetizer, best eaten with some totopos corn chips, especially in a hot summer day.

ingredients:Here are the ingredients for about two adult portions:

* 2 Hass avocados
* 1/4 medium onion
* 1 small tomato
* Cilantro
* 1 lime

And of course, some totopos to eat with.

directions:
- Cut the avocados in half, open them and place the pulp in a bowl.
- Mash the avocados, add lime juice, mix and mash some more.
- Mince the cilantro, tomato and onion and add them to the avocado mix.
- Add salt and black pepper to taste and mix thoroughly.
- Enjoy fresh with some totopos!

This recipe is best consumed fresh, since the avocado oxidizes pretty fast and might lose its appetizing color and texture in just some hours.
