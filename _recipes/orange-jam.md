This jam is a traditional topping for the Polish [mazurek](/recipes/mazurek), but
can be used as a generic sweet spread.

ingredients:
- 4 medium sized oranges
- 1 lemon
- 1 1/2 cup sugar

directions:
- Zest all fruit.
- Peel off the albedo (the white part under the skin).
- Blend the fruit (not too much, it doesn't need to become an even mush, just cut up into small pieces).
- Combine the blended fruit, zest, and sugar in a pot.
- Bring to boil and boil for 30-40 minutes on low heat. The mixture will thicken as water evaporates. Note that it will thicken even further once it cools, so don't boil for too long - it is expected to be still a little runny at the end of boiling.
