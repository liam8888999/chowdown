ingredients:
- 1-2 Broccoli (fresh best, frozen works too)

- Put broccoli in and steam with lid on for approx. 3 minutes.
- Drain broccoli and wipe pan dry.
- One teaspoon of oil and saute garlic and ginger (use sesame seed oil for Asian touch, but neutral or olive oil works well too).

- Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar and lemon juice to your taste.
- Thicken sauce with corn starch.
- Put dry cooked broccoli back in and saute for very short time (you want it nice and crunchy).
