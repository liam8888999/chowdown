Okonomiyaki is a Japanese savory pancake.  Instead of using air bubbles to lighten the pancake, thin strips of cabbage provide levity to the cake.  This is a very popular street food in Japan, and can be topped with all sorts of different ingredients, as "Okonomiyaki" roughly translates to "Grilled how you like".
