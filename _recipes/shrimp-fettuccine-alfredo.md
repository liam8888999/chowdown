Shrimp fettuccine alfredo is one of the best tasting and low effort dishes.
The recipe i give below yields an alfredo sauce that is a bit on the thicker side.
If you want a thinner sauce, adding a touch or two more milk will thin out the sauce.
This is a great meal for 3-4 people or you can eat one serving and freeze the rest for 2-3 more dinners.

- Cook time: 10-20 minutes (Noodles take most of the time)
