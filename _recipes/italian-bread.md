prepTime: 2.5 - 3.25 hr
cookTime: 25-30 min

ingredients:
- 600g or 5 cups bread flour (or all-purpose if not available)
- 1 packet (appr. 2 1/4 tsp or 7g) active dry yeast
- olive oil for greasing

directions:
- Follow directions on the packet to activate yeast in a bowl large enough for mixing the dough
- Add enough water for a total of 400g or 1 3/4 cups (i.e. add 400g minus however much water was used to activate the yeast)
- Optionally add 12g or 2 tsp salt (Unsalted bread is normal in Central Italy, but it's an acquired taste)
- Slowly mix in flour until it forms a dough that will be easy to work with and not overly sticky. Make sure there are no wet or dry pockets in the dough.
- Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
- Knead the dough and let it rise covered for 1 hour in a warm place until doubled in size.
- Split the dough in half and shape it into two loaves. Make sure the seams are at the bottom.
- Place the loaves on a lightly greased baking sheet and let it rise covered for 1 hour in a warm place until doubled in size.
- Make sure the oven is preheated to 200°C (400°F) before the resting period is over.
- Score the loaves and place the baking sheet in the oven.
- Bake for 25-30 minutes.
- Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
