This is a take on a traditional demi-glace without needing to buy an astronomically large amount of veal bones. Use this as your main base for pan sauces, an extra flavor bomb, or a replacement for recipes that call for broth or stock.

These are the basic proportions -- multiply as needed. I typically multiply by six to give me several weeks worth of demi-glace ice cubes.

ingredients:
- 1 qt (32 oz, 946mL) **low-sodium** broth or stock (I prefer Pacific Foods)
- 1 1/4 oz (7g) packet **unflavored, unsweetened** gelatin
- 1 teaspoon (5mL) tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon (5mL) **low-sodium** soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (_very_ optional)

directions:
- Put the tomato paste in a large pot, _then_ turn the heat on medium
- Spread the paste around the bottom of the pot and stir until it just barely starts to brown
- Deglaze with the broth
- Stir in all other ingredients and boil over high heat until reduced to about 1/6th of its original volume
- Freeze in ice cub trays
