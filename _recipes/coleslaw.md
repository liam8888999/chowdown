This is a coleslaw recipe that I got from a chili restaurant in my neighborhood that closed down a few years ago. This recipe makes more dressing than needed for the coleslaw, so you can save it or use it as a vegetable dip.

prepTime: 25 min
- ðŸ¥¶ Fridge time: 1 hr
recipeYield: 8 - 10

ingredients:
- 3/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 4 tbsp distilled vinegar
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 tsp celery seeds
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp granulated garlic
- 1/4 tsp mustard powder
- One large head of green cabbage
- One large carrot

directions:
- Finely shred, rinse, and drain the carrot
- Finely shred the cabbage (use a food processor if possible)
- Whisk together the mayonnaise, buttermilk, lemon juice, cider vinegar, distilled vinegar, olive oil, and sugar
- Add the salt, pepper, celery seeds, onion powder, and granulated garlic, and combine well
- Combine the shredded cabbage and carrot in a separate bowl
- Slowly add the dressing until it lightly coats the vegetables, and toss well. Add more dressing until it tastes good
- Refrigerate for at least an hour before serving
