A recipe for Glühwein/mulled wine a beverage you can find at almost every European christmas market. This recipe is my favorite one - optimized for flavor rather than alcohol content (it still kicks in).

recipeYield:1-4

ingredients:for 1 liter of Glühwein

- 300 ml Cassis-Juice (Johannesbeer), if you can't find it you can replace it with another juice, I did it e.g. with cranberry pomegranate juice
- 1 bottle 700ml red wine (I prefer Primitivo/Zinfandel), don't buy a cheap cooking wine, you want to drink it :)
- 50 g Sugar
- 25 g Raisins
- 1 orange
- 1 cinamon bark
- 1 spoon ginger powder (or a bit of fresh ginger)
- 1 spoon cloves
- 5 star anise
- if you don't have the spices you can also just throw in sweet cinamon tea bags instead (or similar), they contain most spices - I took 6 teabags for 1 litre

directions:
- cut the orange in nice looking pieces (since they are mainly decoration)
- throw everything in a pot
- warm up (don't boil)
- enjoy
