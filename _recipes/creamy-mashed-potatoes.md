Mashed potatoes is a really great recipe that is often relegated to the position
of side dish. This recipe is a spin of the classical mashed potatoes recipe
that's got itself more going on. You can serve this dish for a relatively light
meal, or you can also serve it as a side dish if you want to have a really
hearty meal.

eating this as a side dish, it might be more like 6-8 portions.

- 200ml milk*
- 200ml mayonnaise*
- ~100g cheese
- Garlic powder
- 12-16 strips of bacon

\*You can play with the proportions depending on how creamy or dry you want the
mashed potatoes to be.

directions:
- Peel and cut the potatoes into medium sized pieces.
- Put the potatoes in a pot with some water so that it covers the potatoes and boil them for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.

- Warm up the milk and mayonnaise.
- Shred the cheese.
- When the potatoes are done, remove all water from the pot, add the warm milk and mayonnaise mix, add some butter, and mash with a potato masher or a blender.
