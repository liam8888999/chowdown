prepTime: 10 min
cookTime: 315 min
recipeYield: 4

ingredients:
- 1/2 lb Ground Beef
- 1 can (400mL) Coconut Milk
- 1 Red Chili Pepper
- 1/2 cup Red Curry Paste
- 4 tsp Peanut Butter
- 3/4 cup Jasmine Rice
- 2 Tbsp Cilantro
- 1 Sweet Bell Pepper
- 1/2 Onion (2 oz), chopped
- 1 Tbsp Garlic Puree
- 1 oz Peanuts, chopped
- 1/2 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- 2 Tbsp Mild Curry Paste

directions:
- Start rice. While water comes to a boil, core and cut pepper into 1/2 inch pieces. Roughly chop cilantro. Finely chop the chili pepper - remove seeds for less heat.
- Add rice to boiling water. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until rice is tender and absorbed, about 12-14 minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered.
- While rice cooks, heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of oil, then the beef and garlic puree. Cook, breaking up beef into smaller pieces, until no pink remains (4-5 mins).
- Add peppers and onions to the pan with beef. Cook, stirring occasionally until softened (2-3 mins). Add mild curry paste, red curry base, soy sauce, peanut butter, and the minced chili pepper. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant (1 min).
- Add coconut milk to the pan. Cook, stirring often, until curry thickens slightly (2-3 mins).
- Fluff rice with a fork. Add half the cilantro and season, then stir to combine. Divide rice between plates and top with beef curry. Sprinkle peanuts and remaining cilantro over top.
