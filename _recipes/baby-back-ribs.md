title: "Baby Back Ribs"
tags: pork, american, supper, southern

ingredients:
- Applewood (or other sweet cooking wood such as cherry or maple)
- 2 baby back rib racks
- 1 container of barbecue rub ([Traeger Pork and Poultry Rub](https://www.traeger.com/rubs-spices/pork-poultry) is recommended)
- Tin foil
- Bag of brown sugar
- Bottle of honey
- Barbecue Sauce ([Oakland Dust, The One BBQ Sauce](https://www.sincerelysf.com/products/oakland-dust-the-one-bbq-sauce-1) is recommended)
- (Optional) A stick of butter

directions:
- Preheat your smoker to 180 degrees Fahrenheit using applewood.
- Take the membrane off of the back of the ribs if your butcher hasn't already done so ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQVIMKDpZfg))
- Cover both sides of the ribs heavily in your barbecue rub, and let sit at room temp for 30 minutes.
- Place the ribs bone down (meat up) on your smoker, and let smoke at 180 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 hours.
- Take the meat out and place on top of two sheets of tin foil. Then, apply a generous amount of brown sugar and honey to both sides of the ribs, followed by a small amount of the barbecue rub. If you have butter, cut it into slices and add it on the meat side (butter is optional).
- Wrap your ribs in the tin foil and place them back on the smoker at 225 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 hours.
- Take your ribs out of the foil and place them bone down (meat up) on your smoker.
- Apply a generous helping of your barbecue sauce to the ribs once every 30 minutes for an hour (twice).
- Take out of smoker and cover in tin foil, allow to sit for 10-30 minutes before serving.

Some classic and delicious baby back ribs. Keep in mind that if you do not have a smoker, a grill with some tin-foil wrapped smoking wood with poked holes will suffice.
