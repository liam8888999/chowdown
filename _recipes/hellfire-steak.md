I first learned this recipe from a Bishop I had growing up. It produces quite a good steak despite the unconventional ingredients.

ingredients:
- Steak
- Kosher Salt
- Mustard Powder
- Tabasco Sauce

directions:
- Rub a generous amount of salt all over the steak
- Coat the entire steak with mustard powder
- Pour Tabasco Sauce onto both sides of the steak, don't be afraid to put more on than you think you might otherwise be comfortable with the salt will cancel out a lot of the spice while grilling.
- Grill over low heat until steak is cooked to your preference.
