If you are feeling quite hungry after just waking up and want to have a
breakfast to fill your HP and stamina bars for the day, I've got just the
perfect recipe for you.

To be honest, this is more of a build-your-own dish. What I am providing here, I
would say, is more of a starting point and you're more than welcome to add (or
remove) anything you'd like. I also have to say that this is not exclusively a
breakfast dish, I've had it for breakfast, for lunch, for supper, for dinner,
etc. Although, I guess when you're a student just any food at any time of the
day will do.

ingredients:Since I more often than not cook this only for myself, the ingredient list below
is calculated for one person. Once more, this is not a strict ingredient list,
so you can really add anything you want. I would say that the only ingredients
that are a most are the eggs and the potatoes. The rest of the ingredients I
will mark with * for the ones that I usually use, and ** for ingredients that I
have used, but seldom use.

- 2 eggs
- 2 small/medium-sized potatoes
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 4-6 bacon strips*
- ½ an onion*
- Cheese (I usually use Gouda)*
- Paprika*
- A couple of Champignon 'shrooms**
- Some slices of bell pepper**

directions:
- Cut the bacon into pieces and fry it on a pan.
- Cut the potatoes into small cubes.
- After frying the bacon, set aside and use the bacon grease to fry the potatoes over medium/medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.
- Add some salt and paprika to the potatoes, mix well and cook for another ten minutes.
- Cut the onions and add them to the frying pan. Cook for about five minutes.
- If you decide to add some vegetables, like mushrooms or peppers, add them now.
- Now, there are two ways you can cook the eggs.*
    * Beat the eggs in a bowl and the pour them onto the pan.
    * Or just crack the eggs directly on the mix in the pan and mix everything
      thoroughly.
- Cut the cheese into small slices and add it.
- Cook for a couple of minutes more, until eggs are cooked enough. Don't let the eggs dry (unless that's the way you like your eggs ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯).
- For the final touch, chop the parsley (or whatever other spices/herbs you decided to use) and add it on top.
- Serve hot and add some freshly ground pepper.

\*Personally, I prefer to beat the eggs first in a bowl before adding them to the
frying pan.
