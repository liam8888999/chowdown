prepTime: 15 min
cookTime: 45 min
recipeYield: 10

ingredients:
- 225g unsalted butter, softened
- 225g caster sugar
- 4 eggs
- 225g self-raising flour
- 1 lemon, zested

For the drizzle topping:

- 1½ lemons, juiced
- 85g caster sugar


directions:
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
- Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.
- Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.
- Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.
- Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
- While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.
- Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.
- Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve.

## Note

- Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
