This is a simple outline of how to cook pasta.
TL;DR: you boil it.
Pasta is usually eaten with some kind of [pasta sauce](/recipes/pasta-sauce) or used in another dish.

ingredients:
- pasta
- basil (optional)
- butter (optional)

directions:
- Fill a large pot about half or 3/4th full with water.
- Salt the water profusely. The rule of thumb is that water for boiling pasta should taste as salty as the sea.
- Bring water to a rolling boil.
- Now add pasta.
- Keep it boiling, but decrease heat as it tries to overflow.
- Wait until pasta is at the preferred softness (see below), then strain it.
- While the pasta is sitting in your strainer, you may add basil leaves or other herbs and aromatics. I also recommend taking a knob or so of room temperature butter and add it in and stirring it, melting it into the pasta.

### How long should pasta be cooked?

The often recommended way to cook most pasta is *al dente*, which often means "slightly undercooked," or with a subtle firmness that makes it still substantial.
Cooking pasta more than that is no great crime,
but if you keep it in there for *too* long, it'll become mush.
